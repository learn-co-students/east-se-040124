#✅ 1. Create a condition to check a pet's mood
    # If "pet_mood" is "Hungry!", "Rose needs to be fed."
    # If "pet_mood" is "Rowdy!", "Rose needs a walk."
    # In all other cases, "Rose is all good."

#✅ 2. Create a ternary operator using "pet_mood" as a condition:

#✅ 3. Create a function (say_hello) that returns the string "Hello, world!"

#✅ 4. Create a function (pet_greeting) that will return a string with interpolated pet's name

#✅ 5. Move conditional logic from Deliverable 1 into a function (pet_status) so that we may use it with different pets / moods

#✅ 6. Create a function (pet_birthday) that will increment a pet's age up by 1. Use try / except to handle errors. 
    # If our function is given an incorrect datatype, it should handle the TypeError exception and alert the user
    # pet_birthday(10) => "Happy Birthday! Your pet is now 11."
    # pet_birthday("oops") => "Type Error Occurred"
